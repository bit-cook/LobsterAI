# Skin Pack MVP Asset Contract

The MVP contains exactly two generated raster assets. Both are content images, never executable theme code.

## `workspace.backdrop`

- Format: PNG, JPEG, or WebP.
- Composition: landscape, preferably 16:9 and 2K-class.
- No text, logos, UI mockups, watermarks, borders, or fake controls.
- Keep the central content band and lower prompt-input area low-detail.
- Put the main decorative focal point toward an outer third.
- Use broad shapes and restrained contrast so the host's fixed wash can preserve readability.
- The same image may be reused by the active conversation view at a host-controlled low opacity. Do not generate a separate conversation background.

Prompt suffix template:

```text
Create a polished desktop application atmosphere backdrop in the shared art direction. Landscape 16:9 composition, no text, no logo, no UI, no watermark. Keep the central 45% and lower 25% visually quiet for readable interface content. Place the decorative focal interest near an outer third, with broad shapes, controlled contrast, and clean edges suitable for CSS cover cropping.
```

## `home.emblem`

- Format: PNG, JPEG, or WebP.
- Composition: square.
- Must remain recognizable at 48 px.
- One centered, bold silhouette with minimal interior detail.
- No words, letters, captions, or imitated product names.
- An opaque, rounded-square badge is valid. Transparency is not required.
- It is a Cowork home skin emblem, not a replacement for the operating-system app icon, startup branding, export watermark, user avatar, or agent avatar.

Prompt suffix template:

```text
Create one compact square application emblem in the shared art direction. A single bold centered silhouette, strong small-size readability at 48 pixels, minimal interior detail, clean edge, no words, no letters, no caption, no watermark. Use an intentional opaque rounded-square badge background when transparent output is not guaranteed.
```

## Forbidden outputs

- Icon collections or sprite sheets.
- Sidebar, toolbar, status, permission, warning, loading, Artifact, file-type, user, or agent icons.
- Fonts, CSS, SVG, HTML, scripts, animations, or layout definitions.
- More than one result per slot.
